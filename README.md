# Retiree Life Liability Tool

Python and Streamlit toolkit for modeling retiree group life insurance liabilities under flexible benefit reduction schedules, mortality assumptions, yield curves, and premium runout assumptions.

## What It Does

- Defines a standard participant intake.
- Projects expected death benefit cashflows.
- Projects present value of future premiums payable to an insurer.
- Supports participant premiums, flat premiums, rates per 1,000 of coverage, age-banded rates, and target loss ratio premium projections.
- Supports fixed discount rates, custom spot curves, and public curve CSV imports.
- Supports custom mortality tables, SOA-style table exports, and improvement scales.
- Supports arbitrary reduction schedules by attained age, duration, or calendar year.
- Provides a Streamlit dashboard for uploads, assumption management, results, and exports.

Suggested GitHub repository name: `RetireeLifeLiabilityTool`.

## Participant Intake

Required columns:

| column | description |
| --- | --- |
| `participant_id` | Unique participant identifier |
| `sex` | `M`, `F`, or another value supported by the mortality table |
| `date_of_birth` | Required date of birth; attained age is computed from the valuation date as `(valuation_date - date_of_birth) / 365.25` |
| `coverage_amount` | Current life insurance amount |

Optional columns:

| column | description |
| --- | --- |
| `annual_premium` | Annual premium payable to insurer |
| `premium_end_age` | Age when premium payments stop |
| `reduction_schedule_id` | Schedule key from uploaded reduction schedule |
| `mortality_multiplier` | Participant-specific mortality load |
| `coverage_start_age` | Age at which current coverage became effective |
| `cohort` | Cohort key for assumption overrides, such as `union` or `non-union` |

See `examples/participants.csv`.

## Premium Projection

The dashboard supports these premium bases:

- `Participant annual_premium column`: uses the participant file annual premium.
- `Flat annual premium amount`: applies one annual dollar premium to every surviving participant.
- `Flat rate per 1,000 coverage`: applies one rate to each participant's projected benefit amount.
- `Age rate per 1,000 coverage`: interpolates an uploaded age/rate table and applies it to projected benefit amount.
- `Target loss ratio`: sets expected premium cashflow equal to projected death benefit cashflow divided by the target loss ratio.
- `Current premium graded to target loss ratio`: trends the participant file annual premium, then linearly grades expected premium cashflow to the target-loss-ratio premium over the selected grade period.

Age-banded premium rate CSV:

```csv
age,rate_per_1000
65,8.00
70,12.00
75,18.00
```

## SOA PRI-2012 and MP Dropdowns

The dashboard includes dropdowns for sex-specific SOA MORT table pairs:

- PRI-2012 amount-weighted tables
- PRI.H-2012 headcount-weighted tables
- PRI-2012 juvenile tables
- MP-2014 through MP-2021 improvement scales

The app reads SOA exports from `data/soa_exports` first. If a CSV is missing, it attempts to download it from `https://mort.soa.org` and saves it to that folder. This lets cloned copies run without live SOA downloads once the cache is populated.

To populate or refresh the local SOA cache:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/cache_soa_tables.py
```

If a corporate certificate setup causes SSL verification failures while populating the cache, you can use this only for controlled one-time cache population:

```bash
RETIREE_LIFE_SOA_SSL_VERIFY=false python scripts/cache_soa_tables.py
```

The app uses the SOA table identity for the participant sex: female participants use the female table identity and male participants use the male table identity. Cohorts can each select a different PRI-2012 base table, so a `union` cohort can use a different sex-specific base table pair than a `non-union` cohort. Custom uploaded mortality and improvement files remain available for locked-down production workflows.

Gender is always mapped from the participant `sex` field to the gender-specific base table. Cohort-level mortality multipliers can be entered in the dashboard and applied through the participant `cohort` column.

Fractional attained ages use UDD. For a projection year beginning at age `x + r`, the one-year death probability is derived from survival over the remaining `1-r` part of age `x` and the first `r` part of age `x+1`.

Mortality improvement uses the selected mortality base year, defaulting to `2012` for PRI-2012 tables, and the valuation year as the current year. Duration 0 mortality includes cumulative improvement from the base year up to the valuation year; later projection years continue generationally from there.

Participant files should not supply age as a substitute for `date_of_birth`; age is recalculated on every run from the selected valuation date so PVs respond to valuation date changes. The Excel reproduction is `=(valuation_date - date_of_birth) / 365.25`.

## Assumption Files

```

The same reduction schedule file can contain simple tabular schedules and standardized rule types. Rows with `basis`, `point`, and `factor` are treated as tabular schedules. Rows with `type` are treated as rule schedules.

The dashboard default reduction schedule is a portfolio-level override when that schedule ID exists in the uploaded reduction file. If the default ID is not present, the model falls back to each participant's `reduction_schedule_id`. If neither ID is known, no reduction is applied.

The Streamlit Reduction Schedule Builder can create and visually test standardized rule types:

- `monthly_stepdown`: reduces by a fixed percentage of initial coverage each month after `start_age`, subject to `minimum_factor`.
- `annual_stepdown`: reduces by a fixed percentage of initial coverage each year after `start_age`, subject to `minimum_factor`.
- `fixed_amount_by_age`: sets coverage to fixed dollar amounts by attained age using `age` and `amount` rows.
- `fixed_percent_by_age`: sets coverage to fixed multiples of initial coverage by attained age using `age` and `factor` rows.

Custom spot yield curve CSV:

```csv
term,rate
1,0.045
5,0.041
10,0.039
```

Rates are annual effective decimal spot rates. For public curves, the app can ingest a CSV URL if it contains maturity/rate fields or Treasury-style columns.
